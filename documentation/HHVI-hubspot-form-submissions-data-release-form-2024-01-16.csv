Title of Dataset,AusUrbHI Heat Health Vulnerability Indicices for NSW Cities and Regions
Collection Title,
Abstract,"This dataset offers a nuanced perspective on population vulnerability to extreme heat at SA1 level, created from a blend of demographic factors, environmental conditions, and urban morphology datasets. The indicies are structured into layers of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity."
Data Purpose,"The dataset reveals elements that influence broader spatial vulnerability patterns, playing a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating risks in the most vulnerable areas, thus fostering healthier, more resilient urban environments. "
Lineage,"The datasets was generated using AURIN datasets and addiitonal external datasets (e.g., land surface temperature raster). Input datasets were harmonized through varies processing technics accordingly, such as disaggregation, raster to vector transformation, and concordance. The study produces Heat Health Vulnerability Indices (HHVI) for each SA1 region within the case study area using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Multiple indices are produced to assess differences in downscaling techniques and are calculated over the two most-recent census years (2016 and 2021) to assess changes in vulnerability over time. The index methodology utilises multiple PCA factors scaled by explained variability to produce more complex and data-driven indices from up to 44 indicators of heat exposure, population sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The generated HHVI was then verified by individual SA1 level linked health data via a time-stratified case-cross study design by comparing the lowest and highest quartiles of vulnerability to hospital admissions during heatwave and non-heatwave days. The study maps areas at high risk of heat stress, correlating these regions with human health and environmental factors."
